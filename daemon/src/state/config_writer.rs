//! The one place `config.json` is written.
//!
//! # Why this module exists
//!
//! `AppConfig::save()` serialises the *whole* struct. Any writer that read a
//! config, did something slow, and then saved that copy silently reverted every
//! field another subsystem changed in between. That defect shipped three times
//! from three unrelated call sites (the startup update check, the long-lived
//! `UpdateService` snapshot, and a debounced volume write), and each was patched
//! on its own. Patching writers one at a time cannot work: the mistake is
//! available to every new writer by default.
//!
//! So the *shape* is what changed. `save()` is no longer reachable from outside
//! `crate::state`; the only way to write is [`apply`], which takes a mutation
//! and runs it against state this module owns. Holding an `AppConfig` across
//! time and writing it back is not a discouraged pattern here - there is no API
//! that accepts one, so it cannot be expressed.
//!
//! # What a mutation may assume
//!
//! The closure gets `&mut AppConfig` holding the newest known state, and should
//! touch only the fields it is responsible for. Two subsystems mutating
//! different fields compose: each runs against the result of the other, so
//! neither can revert the other's work. That is the merge semantics the old
//! read-modify-save pattern lacked.
//!
//! # Threading
//!
//! Writers live on the console UI thread, the audio engine thread, tokio tasks
//! and the tray callback. A `Mutex` authority rather than a writer thread is
//! deliberate: every existing writer is synchronous and several read the result
//! back immediately (the Ctrl+Alt+M handler needs the toggled value to move the
//! engine's own cached flag in the same call). A channel would make all of them
//! async and need a reply path per call site; the mutex gives the same
//! serialisation with none of that. Contention is nil in practice - writes are
//! user-driven, not per-keystroke.
