//! In-RAM ring buffer of the app's recent log lines, for the Debug section in
//! Settings.
//!
//! Keeps the most recent lines in memory so the UI can show them and the user
//! can export them on request.
//!
//! # Rules this module enforces
//!
//! - **Nothing is written to disk** until the user presses Export. The buffer
//!   is memory-only and fixed size, so an app left running for a week costs
//!   the same as one just launched.
//! - **No key identities, ever.** Verbose mode routes per-keystroke timing
//!   lines here with the key masked (see [`mask_key_identities`]). Timing is
//!   what latency reports need; which key was struck is not, and a log the
//!   user is about to mail somewhere must never carry it.
//!
//! # Cost on the logging path
//!
//! A `Mutex<VecDeque>` with a short critical section (timestamp format, push,
//! pop-front). That is acceptable here because the app does not log in steady
//! state: the audio engine's `handle_key_event`/`handle_mouse_event` and the
//! worker-host read loop contain no logging on the per-event path, so with the
//! viewer closed and verbose off, typing produces zero pushes. The call sites
//! that do log are startup, config changes, device switches, soundpack loads
//! and errors - all of them rare and none of them latency-critical.
