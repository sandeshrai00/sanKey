//! UI-side half of the Windows input worker: spawns the worker process,
//! reads its event stream, and feeds the existing keyboard/mouse/hotkey
//! channels so the audio engine (`audio/engine.rs`) sees exactly what it saw
//! when rdev produced those events.
//!
//! Everything that needs `AppConfig` lives here rather than in the worker:
//! per-device filtering and the Ctrl+Alt+M hotkey. That keeps config in one
//! process and the pipe one-directional.
//!
//! If the worker cannot be kept alive (spawn failure, or it dies
//! `MAX_RESTARTS` times), this falls back to the old rdev + device_query
//! listeners: the focus bug comes back, but the app still makes sound.
