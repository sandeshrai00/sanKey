//! Opt-in latency tracing for the input -> engine -> UI path.
//!
//! Enabled by setting `SORAKEY_TRACE=1` before launching. When it is unset
//! (the shipping default) every entry point below is an atomic load that fails
//! immediately, so the hot paths pay a predictable branch and nothing else.
//!
//! # Why it is built this way
//!
//! The paths being measured are exactly the paths that must never block: the
//! audio engine loop, the worker-stdout reader, and the UI poll loop. Doing
//! I/O on any of them would create the very stall we are trying to find, so
//! recording a point only pushes a small `Copy` record onto an unbounded
//! channel; a dedicated writer thread owns all formatting and output.
//!
//! # What comes out
//!
//! One compact line per keystroke on stderr, so it lands in the `console`
//! console the user is already watching, with each hop's duration and the slow
//! hop marked. A full per-hop log is written to a file at the same time for
//! offline analysis - the console line is the product, the file is the detail.
